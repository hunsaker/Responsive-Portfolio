        <p>Some people say a man is made outta mud. A poor man's made outta muscle and blood. Muscle and blood and skin and bones. A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong.</p>
    
        <p>I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine. I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine. I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal. And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul."</p>
      
        <p>Fightin' and trouble are my middle name. I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion. Can't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line.</p>        
       
        <p>If you see me comin', better step aside. A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died. One fist of iron, the other of steel. If the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will.</p>
       
        <p>You load sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store.</p>
